title: Running programs

{% include menu.html %}

In [one of the previous section](../hello-world), we created a simple program but did not run it yet. There are many ways of running the program: using an installed command-line tool, using a REPL shell, running a program directly from an [IDE](../editors-and-ides) or using an online service such as [glot.io](https://glot.io/new/raku), or using a docker container.

There are five topics in this section. Browse all of them or examine only those that you find suitable for your needs. After the sections, there is an assignment.
