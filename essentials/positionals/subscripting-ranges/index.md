title: Subscripting ranges

{% include menu.html %}

A `Range` is a positional data type. As with arrays, you can access its individual elements.

For example, this is how you print the third element in the sequence of items that the range generates:

```raku
my $r = 10..20;
say $r[3]; # 13
```

It is important to realise that ranges, unlike arrays, do not necessarily keep all the values in memory.

## Size

To get the size of the range, use the `elems` method as you do with arrays.

```raku
my $r = 10..20;
say $r.elems; # 11
```
