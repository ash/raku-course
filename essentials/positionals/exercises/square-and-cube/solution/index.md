{% include menu.html %}

## Code 1

A straightforward solution is to use the `**` operator.

```raku
my $n = @*ARGS[0];
say $n ** 2;
say $n ** 3;
```

🦋 Find the program in the file [square-and-cube.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/essentials/positionals/square-and-cube.raku).

## Code 2

A slightly more stylish solution is to use Unicode superscripts.

```raku
my $n = @*ARGS[0];
say $n²;
say $n³;
```

🦋 Find the program in the file [square-and-cube-2.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/essentials/positionals/square-and-cube-2.raku).

## Output

Run the program a few times and test it with different numbers.

```console
$ raku exercises/positionals/square-and-cube.raku 5
25
125
```
