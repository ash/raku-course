title: Notes on using Unicode

Raku assumes that all your program files are saved as UTF-8 files. From the practical point of view, that means that you donâ€™t have to worry about non-ASCII characters in, for example, string literals. But thatâ€™s not only that. You most likely will not need to worry if your program reads a text file that is also a UTF-8 file. It also means that string length is correctly detected as the number of characters and not the number of bytes. (We will have a more detailed look into it later.) 

The next thing you want to know is that you can use non-Latin or non-English letters for identifiers. You can name your variable `$Î¹` instead of `$i` if you prefer, and the compiler will parse it correctly.

Raku treats the Unicode properties of the characters pedantically enough. For example, it not only knows if a character is a letter or a digit, but also correctly identifies pair characters such as parentheses or different kind of brackets. In many cases, you can choose a different type of brackets for separate parts of the program. For instance, you can modify our â€˜Hello, World!â€™ program to use these non-Latin quoting characters (you will see them again when weâ€™ll work with Raku grammars):

```raku
say ï½¢Hello, World!ï½£;
```

Some built-in operators have two forms: a Unicode and an ASCII versions. For example, one can type a negated comparison as `!=` or as `â‰ `. The same applies to set operations: for instance, `âˆˆ` has a pure ASCII equivalent `(elem)`. Or, there is a built-in constant which you can refer to as `pi` or `Ï€`.

When working with numbers, you can choose to use fractions in the form of `Â½` instead of `0.5`. Or, evaluating the square of `$x` as `$xÂ²` using a superscript character.

Find the full list of such pairs at the following documentation page: ðŸ“– [Unicode versus ASCII symbols](https://docs.raku.org/language/unicode_ascii).
