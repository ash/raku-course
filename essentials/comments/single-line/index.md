{% include menu.html %}

The simplest form of a comment is a one-line comment, which starts by the `#` character and goes until the end of the current line.

    my $name; # This variable is used to keep user’s name
    $name = prompt 'What is your name? ';
    say $name; # We see the name now

Notice that a sheebang such as `#!/usr/bin/env raku` in the first line of code is also a comment for Raku, while it can be read and executed by the shell.
