{% include menu.html %}

The name of a function is an identifier that follows the same rules as a [name of a variable](/raku-course/essentials/scalar-variables/identifiers/). It must start with a letter or underscore and can be followed by any letters, digits, underscore character, single quote (apostrophe), and hyphens.

Apostrophes and hyphens must be followed by alphabetic characters. While apostrophes are not widely used in identifiers, hyphens are used quite extensively as they add an additional level of expressivity.

Below is a short list of examples of valid function names.

    greet

    greet-them

    hello-world

    NumberOfItems

    is-valid

    to_bo-or-not_to_be
