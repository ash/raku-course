title: 'Exercise: Echo until enough'

## Problem

Write a program that repeatedly asks to enter a word and prints it in the terminal. If the word is `enough`, the program terminates and prints a final message.

## Example

The program may run infinitely long, but here we only show a couple of iterations.
```console
$ raku echo-until-enough.raku
Your word: language
language
Your word: coding
coding
Your word: enough
enough
OK, done.
```
