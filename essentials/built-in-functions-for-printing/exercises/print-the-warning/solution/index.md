title: 'Solution: Print the warning'

{% include menu.html %}

## Code

Here is the solution:

```raku
my $age = prompt 'What is your age? ';

if $age < 0 {
    note 'You entered a negative number!';
}
else {
    say "Your age is $age";
}
```

🦋 Find the program in the file [print-the-warning.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/built-in-functions-for-printing/print-the-warning.raku).

## Output

A couple of possible cases:

```console
$ raku exercises/built-in-functions-for-printing/print-the-warning.raku 
What is your age? 20
Your age is 20

$ raku exercises/built-in-functions-for-printing/print-the-warning.raku 
What is your age? -1
You entered a negative number!
```

To make sure the error message is printed to STDERR, redirect the output. The prompt to enter the age will not appear, but you can still enter a number. The warning remains visible.

```console
$ raku exercises/built-in-functions-for-printing/print-the-warning.raku > /dev/null
20

$ raku exercises/built-in-functions-for-printing/print-the-warning.raku > /dev/null 
-1
You entered a negative number!
```
