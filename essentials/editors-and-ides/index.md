title: Editors and IDEs for Raku

{% include menu.html %}

The Raku programs are written as plain text and usually are kept in text files (the exception are the programs that you run online or in the command line or prepare to be executed via `EVAL` or some other rare cases).

It is assumed that the program source is a UTF-8 text. You can thus use any text editor that does not save formatting instructions in the document. While you can use `vim`, or `nano`, or `emacs`, or `mcedit` and be happy with your choice, you may also want to try a couple of currently trending applications.
