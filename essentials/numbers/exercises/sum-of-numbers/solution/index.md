title: Solution to â€˜Sum of numbersâ€™
---

{% include menu.html %}

Here is the solution to the problem.

## Code

```raku
my $a = prompt 'Enter number A: ';
my $b = prompt 'Enter number B: ';
my $c = prompt 'Enter number C: ';

my $sum = $a + $b + $c;

say "The sum of numbers is $sum.";
```

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the full code in the file [sum-of-numbers.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/numbers/sum-of-numbers.raku).

## Output

Run the program a few times and confirm it works with the numbers of different kinds.

```console
$ raku exercises/numbers/sum-of-numbers.raku
Enter number A: 1.2
Enter number B: -3.4
Enter number C: 45
The sum of the numbers is 42.8.
```

## Comments

Notice that we are directly using the value returned by the `prompt` routine. That may cause problems if the user enters a string that does not represent a value. We can make the program better in the future after we learn about exceptions.
