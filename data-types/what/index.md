# Introspection with `WHAT`

It is possible to see the type of data that the variable hold by calling the `WHAT` method on it:

    my $n = 42;
    my $s = '42';
    say $n.WHAT; # (Int)
    say $s.WHAT; # (Str)

The type is printed in parentheses as shown in the comments. For example, `(Int)` or `(Str)`.

There is no problem to call a method on a literal itself. For example:

    say 42.WHAT;      # (Int)
    say (-1).WHAT;    # (Int)
    say 'Hello'.WHAT; # (Str)
    say True.WHAT;    # (Bool)

Notice that in the case of `-1` we put the number in parentheses, as `say -1.WHAT` would try to negate the result of `1.WHAT`, which leads to an exception.
