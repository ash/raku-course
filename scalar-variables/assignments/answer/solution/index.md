# The solution

Here is a possible solution to the task.

## Code

    my $answer = 42;
    say $answer;

👀 You can find the source code in the file [answer.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/scalar-variables/assignments/answer/solution/answer.raku).

## Output

Run the program and enter a name when you get the prompt:

    $ raku answer.raku 
    42

## Comments

One of the requirements of this problem was to use variables. As `42` is a single value, it is a good choice to use a scalar variable to store it.
